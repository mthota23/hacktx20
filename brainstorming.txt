Ideas for Hackathon: 

michael's notes
  i'm down for a web app idea
  or even a phone app as well
  i'm not too familiar with game systems/rendering
  
  I think one of the most common idea types is a web app/phone app used to connect people / share information in a certain field.
  
Areas we could capitalize on:
  COVID-19
  University life
  Work/study from home (productivity related? communications / connections related?)
  Data analytics from an API
  
  
Additionally, we could also work on an embedded systems project?
